# web-crawling

Project name: Data acquisition from google

Tools used : 
Software - Python (Programming Language)
Libraries - Selenium, Bs4, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib.

Description: Web crawl data from google and transform useful insights which help in business development.

Working: Developed and optimized the entire ETL workflow to scrape all the URLs from Google by listing the outsourcing companies all over the world. With the help of selenium automation I scraped all the website links with titles and descriptions from Google so that it will be easy to clean the data that makes no sense in the output. From the output again I removed the error values and made that data meaningful by using some python libraries like Pandas and NumPy. Next, we implemented EDA for our better understanding purposes with the help of Matplotlib and Tableau.
